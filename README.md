# sexy-anime-reviews
Simple app engine app that utilizes polymer to display my anime reviews developed completely online.

Few things I wanted to play with:
* complete project developement on a Chromebook (start to finish)
* Polymer 1.0
* Firebase
* Google App Engine
* Cloud9
* bonus: Google authentication in GAE & Firebase


My notes so I don't forget...
Can push to appengine via git or script
 git push appengine
 appcfg.py update .
not sure what happened with upgrade of tools, but now have to use
 ../google-cloud-sdk/.install/.backup/bin/appcfg.py update .
